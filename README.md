Assignment 6: Complexity Analysis
By: Grace Tsui

This assignment dealt with analyzing the complexity of various functions by
writing them in Big-O notation and giving a c and x_0 value (or analyzing
them informally). We also related space complexity with time complexity.

I worked with Eddie and Giang on this assignment. I also received help from
the CS tutor Timothy.
